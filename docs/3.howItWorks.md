# 3. How it works?
DM Customizer is providing a user interface in the `NPanel > DMCustomizer`. You will be able to change the background color, 
the subset color and more of the thumbnail generated by DECALMachine.

DM Customizer will apply its settings during the bake of a decal. So the only thing you need to do is set the colors
and settings you want and use the DECALMachine bake like you use to. A preview button allows you to see what will be the 
result.

!!! info
    The preview is available for multiple decal types, use the dropdown to change the preview.
    <br>**Notice:** The preview is just an example, you still need to bake your decal using DECALMachine

The `Zoom Factor` is for the size of the decal on the thumbnail. Decreasing it under `1` will make the decal smaller, 
increasing it to more than `1` to make the decal bigger.
